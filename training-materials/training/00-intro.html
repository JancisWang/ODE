ODE is a system that can be used to design natural language output
for intelligent agents (such as robots and non-player characters in
computer games) in the form of <i>rules</i>. A rule consists of a name, a
description, a <i>left-hand side</i> (LHS) and a <i>right-hand side</i> (RHS).
The LHS specifies a number of conditions that must be fulfilled for
the rule to apply. The corresponding RHS specifies the natural
language output that should be produced by the agent if and when the
rule applies.
</p>

<p>
As an example, consider the following rule:
</p>

<pre class="example">
// @firstEncounter
// Agent meets someone for the first time.
&lt;Encounter&gt;first -&gt; "Hi! Nice to meet you."
</pre>

<p>
The name of this rule is <code>firstEncounter</code>; its description says that
it covers situations in which an agent meets someone for the first
time. The LHS of this rule consists of a single condition.
Conditions are pairs of <i>features</i> and <i>values</i>. In the example
above, <code>Encounter</code> is a feature and <code>first</code> is its value. The RHS of
this rule consists of a single <i>output string</i> (<code>Hi! Nice to meet
  you.</code>). Output strings can &#x2013; but do not have to &#x2013; consist of
multiple sentences.
</p>

<p>
To make conversations feel as natural as possible it is important
for agents to be able to express the same content in many different
ways. Rules support this by allowing you to specify any number of
alternative verbalizations for the content to deliver. Every time a
given rule applies, the agent will randomly choose and produce one
of these alternative verbalizations. As a result, the more
alternatives there are to choose from, the less likely the agent is
to repeat itself.

To become familiar with ODE's features for working with rules you
will be performing a number of basic tasks. Each task consists of
two parts: an introductory text providing the information you will
need to complete the task, and a description of the task itself.
Tasks are to be completed in the order in which they are presented,
but you are allowed to go back to previous tasks to re-read the
information they provide if necessary. When you are done with a
task, click <button class="btn btn-success
   btn-xs">Next</button> to proceed to the next task. To go
back to previous tasks, click <button class="btn btn-default
   btn-xs">Previous</button>.
</p>

<p>
<i>The goal of this part of the experiment is for you to learn how
the system works.</i> If you find that you are having trouble
understanding the description of a given task, or run into problems
while performing a given task, please let the experimenter know.
They will assist you and answer any questions you might have.
