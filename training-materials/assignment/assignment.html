You will now create 5 rules covering different aspects of a scenario
in which a robot plays a quiz game with a familiar user. Rule names
and descriptions will be provided for you. Please copy-and-paste
them to the appropriate form fields when creating the rules. Your
task is to come up with appropriate input and output for the rules.
</p>

<p>
A printed reference manual describing individual features of the
system will be available to you for the duration of the assignment.
You are free to consult this manual if and when you need a reminder
of how to use a certain feature; there is no need to consult it
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
You will have 45 minutes to finish the assignment, and you can work
on the rules in any order. The assignment starts as soon as you
click the <button class="btn btn-success btn-xs">Start
clock</button> button below. At any given point during the
assignment, you can look at the clock to see how much time you have
left. When time is up you will hear an alert sound. Please stop
working on the rules at that point, and use the <button
  class="btn btn-success btn-xs">Go to
questionaire</button> button at the very bottom of the page
to move to the last part of the experiment. If you are in the middle
of carrying out an operation &#x2013; such as dragging content to a
placeholder or typing in a part or an output string &#x2013; at the time
of the alert, you are allowed to finish that operation, but you may
not carry out another operation after that.
</p>

<p>
Please note that creating rules is an open-ended task by definition:
There is almost always more variation that could be added to the RHS
of a given rule. If you finish creating 5 rules with appropriate
features and some output in less than 45 minutes, use the time
remaining to add more variation to the RHS of the rules.
</p>

<p>
Please read the rule descriptions given below carefully; they
include all the information you need to understand the situations
they cover and figure out which features to add to their LHS. <i>Be
aware</i>, however, that information that applies to multiple rules
will not necessarily be repeated in every description. When in doubt
whether or not to include a specific feature, ask yourself if the
description of the rule you are working on contains any information
that <i>prohibits</i> the use of this feature, and <i>omit the feature only
if it does</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions about the rules you are asked to create,
or the instructions you are currently reading, please direct them to
the experimenter <i>before</i> starting the clock.
</p>

<div class="text-center">
<p>
<i>You are not allowed to ask questions during the assignment.</i>
</p>

</div>

<p>
There is only one exception to this rule: If you run into problems
that make it <i>impossible</i> for you to continue working on the
assignment without assistance, please stop the clock by clicking on
the <button class="btn btn-danger btn-xs">Stop
clock</button> button and notify the experimenter. The
button for stopping the clock will become available after you start
the clock.
